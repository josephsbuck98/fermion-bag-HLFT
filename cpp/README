Must install Eigen:
  linux: sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
  macOS: brew install eigen
  Windows: Install from https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

Need to make sure cmake knows where to find the installation. Can be done by
setting environment variable EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR to /usr/include/eigen3 I think.
